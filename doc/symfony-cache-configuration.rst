Symfony HttpCache Configuration
-------------------------------

The ``symfony/http-kernel`` component provides a reverse proxy implemented
completely in PHP, called ``HttpCache``. While it is certainly less efficient
than using Varnish or Nginx, it can still provide considerable performance
gains over an installation that is not cached at all. It can be useful for
running an application on shared hosting for instance
(see `Symfony HttpCache documentation`_).

You can use features of this library with the Symfony ``HttpCache``. The basic
concept is to use event subscribers on the HttpCache class.

.. note::

    If you are using the full stack Symfony framework, have a look at the
    HttpCache provided by the FOSHttpCacheBundle_ instead.

.. warning::

    Symfony HttpCache support is currently limited to following features:

    * User context

Extending the right HttpCache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of extending ``Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpCache\HttpCache``, your
``AppCache`` should extend ``FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache``.

.. tip::

    If your class already needs to extend a different class, simply copy the
    event handling code from the EventDispatchingHttpCache into your
    ``AppCache`` class. The drawback is that you need to manually check whether
    you need to adjust your ``AppCache`` each time you update the FOSHttpCache
    library.

Now that you have an event dispatching kernel, you can make it register the
subscribers you need. While you could do that from your bootstrap code, this is
not the recommended way. You would need to adjust every place you instantiate
the cache. Instead, overwrite the constructor of AppCache and register the
subscribers there. A simple cache will look like this::

    require_once __DIR__.'/AppKernel.php';

    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\EventDispatchingHttpCache;
    use FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\UserContextSubscriber;

    class AppCache extends EventDispatchingHttpCache
    {
        /**
         * Overwrite constructor to register event subscribers for FOSHttpCache.
         */
        public function __construct(HttpKernelInterface $kernel, $cacheDir = null)
        {
            parent::__construct($kernel, $cacheDir);

            $this->addSubscriber(new UserContextSubscriber());
        }
    }

User Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support :doc:`user context hashing <user-context>` you need to register the
``UserContextSubscriber``. If the default settings are right for you, you don't
need to do anything more. You can customize a number of options through the
constructor:

* **anonymous_hash**: Hash used for anonymous user. This is a performance
  optimization to not do a backend request for users that are not logged in.

* **user_hash_accept_header**: Accept header value to be used to request the
  user hash to the backend application. Must match the setup of the backend
  application.

  **default**: ``application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash``

* **user_hash_header**: Name of the header the user context hash will be stored
  into. Must match the setup for the Vary header in the backend application.

  **default**: ``X-User-Context-Hash``

* **user_hash_uri**: Target URI used in the request for user context hash
  generation.

  **default**: ``/_fos_user_context_hash``

* **user_hash_method**: HTTP Method used with the hash lookup request for user
  context hash generation.

  **default**: ``GET``

* **session_name_prefix**: Prefix for session cookies. Must match your PHP session configuration.

  **default**: ``PHPSESSID``

.. warning::

    If you have a customized session name, it is **very important** that this
    constant matches it.
    Session IDs are indeed used as keys to cache the generated use context hash.

    Wrong session name will lead to unexpected results such as having the same
    user context hash for every users,
    or not having it cached at all (painful for performance.

Cleaning the Cookie Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the UserContextSubscriber only sets the session cookie (according to
the ``session_name_prefix`` option) in the requests to the backend. If you need
a different behaviour, overwrite ``UserContextSubscriber::cleanupHashLookupRequest``
with your own logic.
